Gesture-Controlled Physiotherapy and Assistive Monitoring System

Description
This project implements a gesture-controlled physiotherapy system designed to assist shoulder rehabilitation exercises. The system detects hand movements using infrared (IR) sensors connected to an Arduino and provides real-time voice feedback through a Python application.

 Features
- Hand gesture detection using IR sensors
- Arduino-based sensor data acquisition
- Python GUI using Tkinter
- Real-time voice feedback using gTTS
- Timer-based safety feedback to prevent overexertion

Technologies Used
- Python
- Arduino Uno
- Infrared (IR) Sensors
- Tkinter (GUI)
- gTTS (Text-to-Speech)
- Serial Communication

Application
- Home-based physiotherapy
- Assistive rehabilitation monitoring
- Healthcare technology prototype

Outcome
The system enables users to perform physiotherapy exercises with real-time guidance, reducing the need for continuous therapist supervision.
